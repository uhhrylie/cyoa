    Eating The cookies
  </h2>

  <p style="

      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;">Your stomach growls loudly at the suggestion and you think 'Why not, it can't hurt me' as you
    sit down at the oh so familiar table. Your mother puts a plate of warm cookies on the table in front of you. The
    delicious smell wafts into your nose.</p>
  <p style="
      color:#BFBB98;
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;">You start eating. The taste is addicting. The plate in licked clean in record time. Thats when
    you look up to thank your mother and the face staring back at you is no longer your mother. But the surgeon. Fear
    floods your body.</p>
  <p style="
      color:#BFBB98;
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;">You try and get up and run to get away from this deranged man. But its like you are paralyzed.
    Stuck in that one spot on the chair. He starts laughing maniacally as you slowly lose feeling in your legs then arms
    and soon your whole body. The last thing you saw was the bottle of poision that you somehow failed to notice sitting
    on the counter, right next to a bowl of batter.</p>

  <p style="
      color:#BFBB98;
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;">I am sorry to say but you have not survived.</p>
