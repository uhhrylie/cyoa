  <p style="

      font-weight:900;"> You open your eyes to the bright shining light of a flashlight. As you start to gain
    conciousness, sounds begin to
    filter in your ears. Staticky sounds and the clink of metal. Suddenly, the light in front of you comes into focus. A
    man in blue scrubs and a surgeon mask is focusing intently. All of a sudden that clanking of metal makes more sense
    when you notice a scalpal moving towards your stomach.

      color:#BFBB98;"> OH NO. Panic rushes through you as you start to thrash against the restraints. The
    doctors gives you an evil grin.
    You fight against the restraints holding your wrists for what feels like eternity as the surgeon is taunting you,
    slowly lowering the scalpal closer and closer.</p>
  <div></div>
  <p style="
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight: 900;
      color:#BFBB98;"> One final push and the the restraints give way. The surgeon looks at you in shock. </p>

  <p style="
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight: 900;
      color: #BFBB98;"> "How- What- There's no way" He gasps.</p>

    ">You jump up from the table and to your suprise there are two doors. Both unmarked. Both an
    escape. Which one will you pick? Pick quickly! The surgeon is getting over the shock pretty quickly!</p>
