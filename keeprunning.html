   <p style="

      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;">Within seconds of making inside the station door the car catches up. But he's too late. You go up to the closest cop you can see and beg for help. Then every cop there is running outside to capture that man.</p>
   <p style="
      color:#BFBB98;
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;">"Thank you, truly. We have been trying for months to find and capture him. You have ended his reign of terror." A cop says to you with a gentle smile.</p> 
   <p style="
      color:#BFBB98;
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;">You feel a sense of pride at the fact that you helped s many people. Congrats on surviving this story! It was not an easy feat. If you would like to play again feel free!</p>
