    Front Door
  </h2>
  <p style="

  <p style="

      font-weight:900;">The front door seems like the best for now. If the surgeon catches you on the roof then you will be doomed. You make your wsy down the stairs to see "your mom" sitting in the living room.</p>
  <p style="
      color:#BFBB98;
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;"> "Hey Mom," You say to her trying to sound cheerful, "I am feeling MUCH better now. I think I am going to go to the corner store down the road and get a few snacks, would you like anything?"</p>
  <p style="
      color:#BFBB98;
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;">"I am all set. Be quick and be back soon, it's gettin kind of late" She says grinning widely at you.</p>
  <p style="
      color:#BFBB98;
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;">You try not to sprint as you run to the door. Opening it a gust of cool air hits your face. You start running once it slams behind you. The crispy air whips your face as you make your way to the police station.</p>
  <p style="
      color:#BFBB98;
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;">You hear the engire roar of a car behind you. It speeds up to catch you. Its your best friend! They are trying to talk to you.</p>
   <p style="
      color:#BFBB98;
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;">"Come on! Get in! I'll help you get there faster! You'll be safe don't worry." She says panicked.</p>
  <p style="
      color:#BFBB98;
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;">What do you do? Should you get in the car or keep running?</p>
