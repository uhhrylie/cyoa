    Door One
  </h2>
  <p style="

  <p style="

      font-weight:900;">You decide on door one and push it open. It creaks loudly. You slam it behind you and feel
    around for a latch to lock it. Nothing.You decide to take your chances and look around. It is pitch black and every
    footstep you make echos. </p>
  <p style="
      color:#BFBB98;
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;">You walk for what seems like hours but was really only five minutes. Your eyes have slightly
    adjusted to the darkness and you can see some shapes. But none too recognizable. As you debate your next move, you
    keep walking and thats what it hits you. No, like literally hits you. </p>
  <p style="
      color:#BFBB98;
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;"> You slame into something warm and furry and, moving?!? You gasp in shock and jump back. Then,
    piercing yellow eyes appear in the darkness combined with a growl. You stutter backwards and hit a wall covered in
    something slimy. The creature starts coming towards you. </p>
  <p style="
      color:#BFBB98;
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;"> You don't stand a chance as it attacks you since it is like ten feet tall and pure muscle. You
    have not survived. </p>
