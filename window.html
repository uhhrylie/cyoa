You slowly open the window and look out into the perfect daylight almost too perfect. The roof of the sunroom is your landing pad. You climb out slowly and land softly on the roof. </p>

There is no time to react or try to get out before you are melted into the earth forever. I guess the surgeon really took "the floor is lava" literally! </p>
   <p style="

      font-weight:900;">I am sorry to say you have not survived! </p>
