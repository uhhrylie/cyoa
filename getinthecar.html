      font-weight:900;">Its a shopping list... you connect the dots and look over to no longer see your best friend but the surgeon. He's holding a chlorform soaked rag. Then BAM he attacks you and the chloroform knock you out in seconds.</p>
  <p style="
      color:#BFBB98;
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;"> You open your eyes to the bright shining light of a flashlight. As you start to gain
    conciousness, sounds begin to
    filter in your ears. Staticky sounds and the clink of metal. Suddenly, the light in front of you comes into focus. A
    man in blue scrubs and a surgeon mask is focusing intently. All of a sudden that clanking of metal makes more sense
    when you notice a scalpal moving towards your stomach.
