  <p style="

      font-weight:900;">You rush to the second door and push it open with ease. It slams behind you. You search around and quickly find a lock on the door. You start trying to catch your breath before opening your eyes and looking around. </p>
  <p style="
      color:#BFBB98;
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;">To your suprise you are in your own living room. You look behind you to realize that the door had vanished. A strong smell of cinnamon hits your nose. Everything is normal.</p>
   <p style="
      color:#BFBB98;
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;">You make your way to the kitchen to see your mom baking cookies. Your favorite kind! There is a rack of them cooling down near the window.</p>
   <p style="
      color:#BFBB98;
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;">Hi, how was your day? I though I would suprise you with your favorite cookies!" She says looking at you and grinning with a blindingly white smile.</p>
   <p style="
      color:#BFBB98;
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;">"It was weird. I don't know if it was a dream or not but I was being chased by this evil surgeon who kiddnapped me. I think I might be losing my mind. I think I will go lay down and rest," You say looking at your mom. "</p>
   <p style="
      color:#BFBB98;
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;">"Ofcourse dear, but before you go. Do try a cookie. Come on pull up a seat," She says staring into my eyes with a smile.</p>
   <p style="
      color:#BFBB98;
      font-size: 175%;
      font-weight:900;">Do you eat the cookies? They are your favorite. But on the other hand you also need the rest. Choose Wisely.</p>
